This can be particularly effective as it exploits the trust the target has in the original sender.\\n\\n3. **Whaling**: This is a form of phishing that specifically targets high-profile individuals, such as CEOs or other executives.

These devices are typically considered to be small and relatively low-powered compared to more sophisticated bombs, but they can still pose a serious threat if handled improperly.\n",

The explosive material is usually placed inside the tennis ball and the detonator is connected to it through a fuse or electronic mechanism.\n",
